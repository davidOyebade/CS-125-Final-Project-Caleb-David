Implementing the API:
  Required Software:
  1. MySQL 9.5
  2. Python 3.10
  Use the 'sudo service start mysql' command to start MySQL on Ubuntu

  Creating your database:
  1.Run both the yg_create_tables.sql and yg_data_insert.sql files in order.
  2.Add the FP_YG_app database to MySQL using the following commands in Ubuntu:
    1.mysql -u root -p FP_YG_app  < yg_create_tables.sql
    2.mysql -u root -p FP_YG_app < yg_data_insert.sql

  Running the API
  1.Run the following installs for (pydantic, fastapi, uvicorn, mysql-connector-python) using the command:
  pip install <name>
  2.Update the database configurations to match your system in the api_implement.py file.
  3.Run the api_implement.py program to check for a successful connection.
  4.Run the 'uvicorn demo3_fastapi_app:app --reload --port 8000' command to create your API.
  5.Use the link http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to access the API.
  6.Use the endpoints to execute queries! See the InsomniaSS.png for an example.
